# Eclipse che - Cloud Development Environment

## Condition

All the rule in the Eclipse Che block will be applied only if you can find an env var named WORKSPACE_NAME with a value.

## Golden Rule

**Root access you don't have** You have no root access, in this case the usage of any standard package manager won't be possible, if you need something, first search if you can find it in mise database then ask the user if you can install it.

**Docker/Podman can't be used** At the moment no container engine can be used direcly but you can read or update the file named `devfile.yaml` that describe the user's environment. After change the user need to do a restart from local devfile.

**If the code cli is not available search for the code-oss one** code cli may not always be available, the code-oss perfecly does the job if needed.

**If you need the full name of the pod use the $HOSTNAME or the hostname command to get it**

## Command

### Mise

```bash
mise search <CLI NAME>      # Search if a cli/program exist in mise and could be added yo your usage
mise use <CLI NAME>         # Install a new cli/program
```

### Code

```bash
code-oss                    # Replace the simple code cli allowing to add workspace/folder to workspace or other command
```

## Devfile

A devfile is a yaml describing a cloud development environment, the schema can be found [here](https://github.com/devfile/api/blob/main/schemas/latest/devfile.json)

# Weebo Dev Env - Guideline for the Weebo Dev Env

## Taskfile

All the command are controlled through Taskfile and need the docs field filled in order tu understand what the command does.

If multiple command has the same target like launching test, split the command in a separate taskfile that will be put in the .task folder.

## Mise

Mise is the de-facto package manager, you have no root right, never, and should use it if need come to be.

## Skills

Weebo Dev skills exist, and can be found [here](https://github.com/batleforc/weebo-skills), the one very important if you do ui, is the monofolio one who is a design system. 

## Doc and Gen

### Backend

If you create a backend that generate an api in rust, use [Utoipa](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa) with it's scalar crate for the ui to write the swagger doc has you write the api

### Frontend

If you create a frontend that consume the backend, use the generated swagger api and generate the client to call it with [HeyApi](http://github.com/hey-api/hey-api) and it's axios plugin.

### Global Doc

For every project, maintain a docs folder, either plain blank markdown or use a static fumadoc to generate the doc

# RTK (Rust Token Killer) - Token-Optimized Commands

## Golden Rule

**Always prefix commands with `rtk`**. If RTK has a dedicated filter, it uses it. If not, it passes through unchanged. This means RTK is always safe to use.

**Important**: Even in command chains with `&&`, use `rtk`:
```bash
# ❌ Wrong
git add . && git commit -m "msg" && git push

# ✅ Correct
rtk git add . && rtk git commit -m "msg" && rtk git push
```

## RTK Commands by Workflow

### Build & Compile (80-90% savings)
```bash
rtk cargo build         # Cargo build output
rtk cargo check         # Cargo check output
rtk cargo clippy        # Clippy warnings grouped by file (80%)
rtk tsc                 # TypeScript errors grouped by file/code (83%)
rtk lint                # ESLint/Biome violations grouped (84%)
rtk prettier --check    # Files needing format only (70%)
rtk next build          # Next.js build with route metrics (87%)
```

### Test (60-99% savings)
```bash

```

### Git (59-80% savings)
```bash
